Highly detailed black and white sketch-style illustration, with expressive pencil lines and fine shading. The composition is moody and atmospheric, evoking a sense of mystery. Inspired by A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan Doyle.

In the foreground, a Victorian detective stands facing slightly sideways, wearing a long trench coat and a classic deerstalker hat. He holds a pipe near his mouth with one hand, exhaling a thin wisp of smoke. His expression is serious and focused, deep in thought.

The background features a foggy, deserted 19th-century London street: cobblestone pavement, gas lamps dimly glowing through the mist, faint outlines of brick buildings and iron fences.

The overall style resembles a hand-drawn book illustration: loose but intentional linework, rich in texture and depth. No text, no title, no typographyâ€”only the image.
